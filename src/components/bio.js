      <h1>Hi, I'm Dan.</h1>
      <p>
        I've been working as a Front End Developer, occasional designer, for
        boutique advertising agencies since 2011. In 2018 I changed gears to
        product/SaaS work and I couldn't be happier.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, I very recently joined the team at <a href="http://cisco.webex.com">Cisco</a> to help iron out the UI/UX and design systems of the video platform (video.cisco.com). I'm excited for this new journey! </p> 
      <p>
        Previously I was a Frontend Engineer / UX Engineer at{" "}
        <a href="https://airdna.co">AirDNA</a> — a startup specializing in
        Vacation Rental Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also worked with some great folks and clients at top-notch agencies
        like <a href="http://www.legworkstudio.com/">Legwork</a>,{" "}
        <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/">Deloitte Digital</a>, and{" "}

      <h3>Side Projects & Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2015 I've managed{" "}
        <a href="https://www.denverdevs.org/">Denver Devs</a> — a community of
        9000+ developers & techies based on Slack. Anyone can join us, so give it a look if you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobby time is spent being a forever Dungeon Master for D&D, 3d
        printing, painting miniatures, board games, and video games (Destiny 2 takes up plenty of time there).
      </p>
