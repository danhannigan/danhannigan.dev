            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a tiny update but I decided to move my blog from markdown to a CMS and ultimately landed on Ghost. I tried a few others, but Ghost felt the most straightforward and simple for my needs: just writing blogs. The interface is clean, and works well enough on my phone (so I can quickly capture blog ideas on mobile if I need to and stash them as drafts). <br><br>Using markdown was fun, in theory, but started to quickly show its limitations when I wanted to add images or other content. I know you can do that just fine with markdown - but the process of uploading and managing media via version control was just zero fun to me. <br><br>Oh, I also moved from Netlify to Vercel, not for any big reason - I was just curious how Vercel would work for me after being on Netlify for years. So far I'm happy with it. <br><br>Up next is getting Vercels OG image to work with my site. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in January 2022, I've been on a path of reckoning and recalibration. I dove headfirst into therapy, which went well while also focusing on improving my overall health (since much of my anxiety stems from health / physical feelings). Over time I've learned what my body &amp; mind need and that if I neglect any of these areas, anxiety can start to rumble back up. I'm sure we've all heard the analogy of a body being like a car; you need regular checkups and maintenance to keep that car healthy.</p><h3 id="heres-my-maintenance-schedule-for-anxiety">Here's my maintenance schedule for anxiety:</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>I have to limit my daily caffeine intake. I used to slurp down both cold brew and diet soda on the same day, pushing my caffeine intake beyond 400mg. Now, I keep it to a single cup of coffee a day or two shots of espresso. That's about 64mg to 91mg of caffeine. Any more than that, and my monkey mind starts to chatter.- I have to take medicine daily at the same time. This one is relatively low effort, but it took me a bit to find a system that worked because I can tend to be forgetful about taking my medicine. I now have a small case with my anxiety + allergy meds in it (each in split compartments), and on Sunday, I fill each pod up with seven pills. I also use Apple Health to track my medication since that's a feature in iOS 16.</li>
<li>I have to limit my alcohol intake to one or three drinks a week, but usually much less. A beer, on occasion, used to be something I enjoyed but have to shy away from now. If I drink too much the following day isn't met with your typical hangover; it's met with a substantial uptick in anxiety levels, which can kick off a loop.</li>
<li>I have to move. Maybe not every day, and perhaps not a strenuous activity, but if I begin to neglect movement - even just a couple of weeks - anxiety can come on strong and be harder to control. A daily walk, plus something to get the heart pumping three times a week or so, has been beneficial.</li>
<li>I have to accept fleeting aches and pains. This mantra has been the biggest one for me. Any sharp discomfort or pain can immediately throw me into an anxiety spiral. I have to remind myself some aches and pains can be expected, or a product of prior anxiety, and to let them pass through me. It's much easier said than done, but I'm getting there.</li>
<li>I have to watch and correct my posture constantly. I tend to slump forward and compress my shoulders together, squeezing my chest, which can cause sharp pains to emanate from my chest. It's a freaky reminder to sit straight, pull your shoulders down, relax, and breathe.</li>
<li>I have to plan for when anxiety hits, depending on what I'm doing. Out for a drive? At the mall? Out with friends? Thankfully, most of these activities distract me and keep anxiety (and the accompanying aches and pains) away. But there's always the &quot;just in case,&quot; and thankfully, my SO, which is usually with me, totally understands if I need to step away for a bit.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What I'm saying here may not seem surprising if you've had anxiety or know anyone who has. This maintenance is all run-of-the-mill stuff; hell, I likely have it easier than quite a few people out there. My point isn't to draw attention to myself but to break into that strange stigma around <em>_talking_</em> about anxiety and mental health and what you can do about it. So here it is. None of this should be taken as advice or mirrored without consulting a doctor first.</p><p>But nonetheless: remember to take care of yourselves, folks.<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much like the shoemakers' children, my website has received very little of the same attention and care that I give to my professional work. Typically I've booted up a page in a single day, reaching for whatever framework or styles look the easiest and calling it at that. This year I wanted to return to my design roots and take a crack at making something for myself that I'd be proud of.</p><p>Before we dive in much further, I won't be writing about how I made my website. It's Next.js, Tailwind, and AirTable. A tale we've heard countless times and not something I need to add to the internet.</p><p>I started the design process by consulting with Jana, my significant other and incredibly talented art director. I haven't focused on just design in so long that I felt out of touch. Where do I start? A simple mood board was her suggestion.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/moodboard-2.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1156" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/moodboard-2.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/moodboard-2.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/moodboard-2.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/moodboard-2.webp 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An image of my site moldboard from Figma&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/moodboard-2-1.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1156" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/moodboard-2-1.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/moodboard-2-1.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/moodboard-2-1.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/moodboard-2-1.webp 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An image of my site moldboard from Figma&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I gathered examples from artists, packaging I like, and, surprisingly, trains. Now, I don't have some fascination with trains; I'm not a train guy (no harm in being one) - but I've always really felt <em>_something_</em> about the typography on trains. The simple, practical nature, typically pure white to contrast whatever industrial metal backdrop it sits on, hits right.</p><p>Despite the magnetic pull from the train typography, I decided to explore more, following the threads I had created from the other examples—futurism, with its beautiful intricate lines, model packaging with its bold typography, and almost militant execution. It all kept circling back to keeping it simple and clean. Jana said at one point, "Your style is like future industrial. You could see it on the side of a giant spaceship somewhere" - and, you know, I like that.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-1.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="1117" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/example-1.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/example-1.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/example-1.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-1.webp 1728w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-2.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="1117" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/example-2.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/example-2.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/example-2.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-2.webp 1728w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-3.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="2976" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/example-3.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/example-3.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/example-3.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-3.webp 1728w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So I dug in further, simplifying the palette and typography - letting the type come to the forefront and pushing back some extraneous elements. The color palette of my "dark mode", with its deep warm grays and blacks contrasted by that marigold, was <em>_very_</em> much a call to modern Tank cars—those big black tubes with white text and that familiar marigold and it started to really feel right to me. I pulled some ideas together, ultimately simplifying and putting my touch on them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-6.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="2976" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/example-6.webp 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/example-6.webp 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/example-6.webp 1600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/example-6.webp 1728w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I splashed some transparent overlays in here and there, something of a nod to Apple's design style, which I'm a big fan of, and working with concepts of "materials." For example, I love frosted glass or acrylic, the harshness and softness it creates work nicely with the overall almost brutalist design. You can see this bit of material in the header, and down in the "Read" &amp; "Play" sections of the homepage if you scroll or swipe sideways.</p><p>For now, I'm content - but as most designers know, it's hard to rest on one's laurels. So I'll likely come back and tweak and adjust things in the future - or find ways to extend what exists with themes. You'd be surprised how much changing the typeface and a few colors can alter the vibe of a design - and I'm excited to play in this space more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[After spending most of 2022 dealing with generalized anxiety disorder, caused by many reasons: always being online, health, and well... *gestures broadly*; I decided to take a break from my community ( Denver Devs ) and Discord. That snowballed into disconnecting from a lot more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>2022 was a rough start for me. Six days into the new year, I wound up at the ER due to chest pain, heart palpitations, and racing thoughts that I couldn't calm down. I knew I was likely okay, but chest pain isn't something I've experienced before, so I thought it best to head into the ER. After multiple EKGs and a blood test, the doctor concluded it was probably just stress and maybe too much caffeine. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician the next day and went in for another checkup. After another series of tests, he concluded that I had a generalized anxiety disorder. We built up a care plan, and I hopped into therapy. My intake test said I was experiencing severe anxiety, stress, and depression levels.</p><p>What source of stress and anxiety was putting me in this spot? After months of therapy, we concluded that I might be spending too much time working. I didn't think I was. My work-life balance with Cisco has been fantastic, but that's when my therapist clarified: Denver Devs, the community I run, is <em>_work_</em>. And it would take up most of my hours outside of paid work. I'm a stubborn type, so I kept pushing through and working on myself - exercising, meditating, doing breathing exercises, and eating better. However, I was still plugged into Denver Devs, and my admin team felt the brunt. I'd wade into our private channels and spew line after line of what ultimately amounted to me just showing how damn burnt out I was.</p><p>July rolls around, and after some more pitfalls around health and life, I decided it's time to check out for a bit, so I let the community know I'm taking August off. The support I received in that move was touching, and immediately I felt stress melt away. So on August 1st, I deleted Discord from my phone and computers. At this time, I also decided to take a break from Twitter, which I'd spend most of my day scrolling through mindlessly as code was built or I was stuck on a problem. So the next day I woke up giddy and took the time to sit outside in the morning and, for once, not check Discord or Twitter immediately.</p><p>But I still felt the nagging in my head to check something... news, feed readers, mail, and so on. So I'd pop open my phone and take in the home page filled with apps, muscle memory would take over, and I'd get to tapping. It wasn't long into the technology sabbatical that I realized: I wasn't really enjoying my time on the internet. So I took it a step further and began the great cleanup of my digital life.</p><p>I got to work by taking cues from the countless books and articles that push this kind of technological disconnect. I unsubscribed from useless email lists and newsletters. Relentlessly purged my RSS feeds. Deleted my news &amp; Reddit apps. Set up screen time limits on my various devices and cleaned up my phone home screen to be something I enjoyed looking at.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/digital-disconnect-homescreen-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/digital-disconnect-homescreen-2.png 600w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/digital-disconnect-homescreen-2.png 1000w, https://ghost.danhannigan.dev/content/images/2022/10/digital-disconnect-homescreen-2.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>A month in, and how am I doing? Well, I learned I like to play Solitare a lot - and had to put an hour daily cap on that. Outside of that, as you might expect, my mind feels quieter. I spend most mornings, sometimes as early as 6:40am to around 8:40am, sitting outside, sipping coffee, and not looking at my phone. I've become such a regular at it that in passing, a neighbor said, "I've seen you on your patio in the mornings. That looks relaxing."</p><p>My work days are happier for it, too. I don't spend time flicking back and forth between distractions. RescueTime reports that I have fewer than 4 context switches in a given hour, which is much better than the 80 plus I had before. I also reduced the physical aspect of my workspace significantly, but I'll save that for another blog.</p><p>Outside work, with friends, or with my significant other, I'm not compelled to check everything. One unexpected side-effect, too, is that I don't feel like spending much time in video games, which is a regular pastime of mine. I'm still figuring out the why on that one. Maybe my mind doesn't need the escapism they provided me.<br>Much of what I'm saying shouldn't come as a surprise. There are books and articles aplenty out there about the benefits of disconnecting. I'm happy I finally took the time and discipline to do it.</p><p>I'm writing this article a few days before my break ends, and I'd be lying if the anxiety wasn't bubbling back up a little. So what's it going to be like when I get back? Do I hop on to all the apps I got rid of and ride that dopamine wave of notifications and new content? I'd rather not, so I've got a plan.</p><p>I'll set office hours for Denver Devs, checking in on the Discord no more than an hour a day spread throughout the day. Of course, if I'm working on something code related to Denver Devs, I'll timebox that a bit too, but honestly, that work is something I enjoy, so I don't see the harm. Outside of Discord, I'm going to set up limits on Twitter. My RSS feed is now just a handful of sources, and I'll keep it that way. I don't think I'll go back to my News apps or Reddit - those places I don't miss checking.</p><p>I'm excited and anxious to see how long I can keep my willpower up and where it takes me. I have missed feeling connected to others. Discord chats and tweets were my main lifeline to other people outside of work and the occasional text message. Still, I need to remember that my goal is to foster positive connections - not constant ones.</p><p>I don't have as much chest pain anymore, and I'd like to keep it that way.<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>
