            <description><![CDATA[This is a somewhat longwinded post about how we met, how we worked it out, and how I finally asked Jana to marry me after ten years of being in each other's lives <3]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I waffled over posting this, with thoughts like "who would care?" and "couldn't this just be a private journal?" ‚Äî but then I reframed my mindset to I'd care, and why can't this lil corner of the internet of mine be something of a journal? So hell yeah, here we go. </p><p><strong>After nearly ten years of dating, I finally asked Jana to marry me, and she said yes! </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://res-1.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/3AF4E03F-EC19-4F75-877B-300D6FC53BD3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1440" height="1800"><figcaption>Hey, that's us!&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><br>I'm over the moon, of course. As the actual proposal got closer, it just felt more like the right thing to do. I wanted to take a bit to dive into the details, too, since plenty of folks have been asking me for them!</p><h3 id="lets-start-at-the-beginning-how-we-met">Let's start at the beginning: how we met.</h3><p>Years ago, in 2013, I ran a little Tumblr blog where I regularly posted design-focused content ‚Äî usually in the form of Dribble likes or random images I found on the net. At the time, I had a few anonymous folks pop into my Tumblr DMs, but one, in particular, went beyond just the "hey, cool stuff" or awkward attempts at hitting on me. <br><br>Out of the blue, this anonymous person was asking me questions and getting to know me. I called them "Mel" because I was convinced it was some dude trolling me. I told "Mel" this, and eventually, we started exchanging emails. Then finally, we swapped photos. Let me tell you, and I was even more convinced that it was a dude catfishing me, given how just... damn pretty she was üòç. <br><br>A little while later, we did phone calls, leading to video calls, leading to having earbuds in our ears on a phone call while we did whatever we had to do that day. ¬†<br><br>She was from Virginia, finishing school and getting her degree in design, and she was wonderful. <br><br>From the start, her wittiness and humor just stuck with me; I felt at ease. We finally met in person in March of 2014, and even though I was nervous as hell, it still just all felt right. <br><br>We went to New York together for a school project of hers and toured around DC and Old Town, Virginia; every minute was a blast. <br><br>Time went on, and a few more visits happened ‚Äî her coming to Colorado and me heading out there again ‚Äî she graduated college and moved out here with me in 2015. </p><p>Now, I'm not going to lie and say everything was perfect. I was struggling with money, insecurity, and jealousy. She was having a hard time finding a job. There was tension, and there were fights, but we stuck with it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://res-5.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/IMG_3095.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="960" height="960"><figcaption>Look at us! A couple of babies on our trip to New York!</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-discussions"><br><br>The discussions.</h3><p>We've casually floated marriage to each other over the years. As a "hey, do you want to do this?" thing ‚Äî and we've both generally been on board. I say "generally" because there were details we still needed to work out. The biggest was money: since I was already struggling financially, I couldn't imagine taking on any wedding or the financial commitments that came with it. I didn't even know how you'd buy a ring without taking out a loan or saving for years. We finally came to terms with our situation and settled into an agreeable place: we'll get married when we can do so comfortably and with as little stress as possible, but our love for one another doesn't need marriage to validate it. ¬†</p><h3 id="the-ring-shopping">The ring shopping. </h3><p>Time breezed on still, and then finally, things started aligning. Work was going better for both of us. We were stashing more money away and settling into each other's rhythms. Communication was getting easier and easier; in November, we said to hell with it, let's go ring shopping. </p><p>We set a budget; Jana found a local jeweler (<a href="https://www.sarahojewelry.com">Sarah O. Jewlery,</a> they're fantastic!) and scheduled an appointment. There was no way I was about to invest that much in something that she might hate, and she was more than happy to come with! </p><p>After almost an hour of a great appointment, she had one picked out, and boy was it beautiful. It was one of a kind and already fit her perfectly. So we picked it up the next day. Seeing that ring on her finger was obvious: she deserved to have something that beautiful with her all the time. ¬†<br><br> I told her the next part, the proposal, would be a surprise.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-1.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/4ECD6D7D-6E5C-41E3-9E47-CF249AA3ECE2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1440" height="1800"></figure><h3 id="the-proposal">The proposal.</h3><p>We were heading to Virginia for the holidays with her parents. I hadn't been there since she graduated in 2015, and I realized this was my chance and the right place to do it. The first day we arrived, I took some time with her folks to talk about it and get their permission ‚Äî to which they promptly replied: "of course, we love you!" </p><p>With the significant stress of buying the ring, traveling with it, and talking to her parents out of the way, I had to figure out when and where exactly. There were two places dear to us both in the area: our first date in Old Town and these rocking chairs at the airport ‚Äî we spent quite a few teary goodbyes there, wondering if we'd see each other again ‚Äî I decided Old Town would be the best option. <br><br>The whole family was out for dinner celebrating her dad's birthday. It was an early one, so by the time we were done with dinner, the sun had just set. I told her sister I planned on making it happen sometime that day and that I could use her help. After dinner, we walked around, taking in Old Town, when her mom popped into a store. Her sister said, "Dad, we should pop in, too!" and that's when I saw my opening. </p><p>I took Jana by the arm and said, "come on, follow me" ‚Äî after a brief bit of a shock on her face, it settled in, and we both started walking towards one specific spot with a few nervous giggles and exchanges of "oh you know what's happening, huh?" After a very brief walk, we got there. <br><br>The place where we first kissed. <br><br>I awkwardly said, "do you remember this?" and reiterated the story of our kiss and what I remembered from that time. The lights, some folks were having a party nearby. Sheepishly I followed that up with, "should I, uh, get on one knee?" (we're very good at this being adults thing) ‚Äî she kinda chuckled and said, "sure, I don't know!" so I dropped down, open the ring box ‚Äî it was upside down! ‚Äî and asked the question: "Will you marry me?". To which she, of course, said yes. Hugs, misty eyes, and kisses were shared, and we snapped a few pics for good measure. <br></p><h3 id="whats-next">What's next?</h3><p>We're already off to the races planning our actual wedding. We're thinking maybe November 2023 or March of 2024 and doing a pretty small-scale thing of just our parents ‚Äî they call that a micro-elopement now; it's hard to keep up with wedding lingo. We'll probably have a party after, too, back in Colorado with all of our friends.<br><br>If you made it this far, you're probably one of the folks in my life that have been around Jana and me enough to want to read this whole story, and for that, I love you and hope to see you at the party &lt;3</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Here's a quick walkthrough of how I overengineered the work from home with other people problem of: "Are you in a meeting right now?" using a Stream Deck & Philips Hue.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sharing a small post to round out the year. My spouse &amp; I have been working from home since the pandemic started; for the most part, it's been fantastic. One tiny hiccup point we kept encountering, which I'm sure many of my fellow WFH crew can relate to, is knowing when they might be at a meeting and, more importantly, their level of involvement. <br><br>Let me clarify: it's easy to tell if someone's in a meeting they're active in - usually because they're chatting about timelines and scope of work randomly at the kitchen counter. Or maybe they dressed up a little more than usual this morning: makeup done, hair done, a nice top. An on-camera meeting is coming up. But what about those in-between moments? A text message or simple check-in during the morning would suffice, but what if you're a techy little nerd that likes to play with colorful lights? Well, I am, so here we go. <br><br>After a few weeks of brainstorming, this execution came to me. And while there are plenty of other posts with similar concepts, I figured why the hell not add to the billions of pages on the net with my own. Oh, now I'm sounding like a recipe blog with how much back story I'm getting to... here's the recipe, er... setup. </p><h3 id="first-some-assumptions-or-things-youll-need-to-get">First, some assumptions (or things you'll need to get): </h3><ul><li> You've got a Stream Deck (or are down to use the app)</li><li>You've got some smart lights that work with the Stream Deck ‚Äî like Phillips Hue in my case ‚Äî and those smart lights are capable of colors, not just white shades. </li><li>You've got someone in your house that likes your weird light system and totally gets it. </li></ul><p>Set up your Stream Deck, grab the appropriate plugin for your smart lights, and set up a Multi-Step process. <br><br>I stuffed a spare Philips Hue light strip into one of those candle hurricane things, and it makes for a pretty cool effect (but doesn't photograph well, sorry). A nice lamp or freestanding bulb itself would probably work just fine. <br><br>Here's how my Steam Deck looks on any given day: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-2.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-1.50.35-PM_o.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1742" height="1548"></figure><p>Oh, all the icons I use (except for Webex) are from Microsoft Fluent Emoji, which I totally love the style of: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji">https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji</a></p><h3 id="here-are-my-three-phases-and-what-the-buttons-do">Here are my three "phases" and what the buttons do:</h3><p><strong>Green:</strong> all good - no meeting. When I hit that button, it sets the light to green, leaves my meeting, and mutes my mic.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-4.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-1.50.58-PM_o.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1742" height="1548"></figure><p><br><strong>Yellow:</strong> caution - I'm in a meeting without my camera on and might need to ramble on about something corporatey at any point. When I hit this button, it just sets the light yellow. That's it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-3.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-1.50.50-PM_o.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1742" height="1548"></figure><p><strong>Red:</strong> on air - I'm in a meeting with my camera on and probably an unmuted mic. When I hit this button, it turns the light red and turns my camera on.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-4.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-1.50.42-PM_o.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1742" height="1548"></figure><p><br>So my workflow is usually meeting starts -&gt; hit the Yellow or Red button -&gt; talk (or listen to someone talk) about TPS reports for however long the meeting is. Meeting done? Hit that green button and go back to life. </p><h3 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts: </h3><p>Why don't I connect to some cool API where meetings get tracked and the light changes automatically? Because I don't need to automate everything, and often my meetings are ad-hoc. Plus, pushing buttons is fun.</p><p>I could probably set it to where the light turns green at the beginning of the workday to signal "all clear!" but then I'd have to account for holidays, days off, etc. And I'm lazy. <br><br>I wish my Stream Deck icons could change their state (like other toggle icons) to let me know which is active. I'm sure I could do this, I just haven't figured it out yet. <br><br><strong>Bonus: what do those other buttons do? </strong></p><ul><li>The bottom left Speaker icon sets my system audio to "speakers."</li><li>The Headphones icon sets my audio to "headphones." </li><li>The Mic on the second row toggles my mic (at the physical level, not at the software level) to mute/unmute. </li><li>The Webex button, uh... pops open Webex. <br><br>How's your workflow going? Have anything cool that you like to use? Let me know! ¬†</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Putting some thoughts out there into the world about burnout, how I don't actually like talking about development, and a potential new project of mine. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>( Sorry for the vague title, I couldn't think of anything else, I promise it's not trying to be click-batey )</p><p>In a recent meeting, I was joking around with some folks on the design team that ‚Äúdevelopers are not my favorite people,‚Äù ‚Äî and while it was a harmless statement at the time, I realized there was some kernel of truth to that. Having run a developer-focused community for over seven years, I‚Äôve learned that I genuinely like interacting with folks over various topics like their hobbies or the latest news. But, on the other hand, I don‚Äôt have a super strong interest in chatting about or engaging in conversations explicitly related to development, frameworks, languages, syntax or code styles, etc.</p><p>Now, I love technology and all the magic it conjures up in my head. I love communities, too. What‚Äôs more, combining the magic of technology with the lifeblood of a community is something I genuinely feel pulled to. Most of my projects since I could remember have been focused on finding a way to connect folks via technology. In design school, I designed websites to get folks together for mountain bike rides. When I took a mini spike on iOS development, I wanted to make a way to get people together for concerts. Denver Devs has been my longest-running project. At the heart of all of them, I just wanted to (and still want to) connect folks.</p><p>So why am I talking about this? There‚Äôs been a consistent feeling about Denver Devs - something akin to burnout - where I don‚Äôt feel invested or attached to many of the specific channels we have and the conversations that take place there. There‚Äôs a solid handful of developer-related channels, and I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to check in on them. Sometimes I feel that lack of interest leads me to make poor decisions or harm the community by not actively engaging in those spaces or encouraging others to do so. From the day I started Denver Devs, I would tell people, ‚Äúanyone can join!‚Äù ‚Äî leaning away from the branding and the audience I was actively attempting to draw to us. Truthfully, when I originally named it Denver Devs, I wanted to call it something else but didn‚Äôt feel qualified enough to speak to non-developers or the tech community in Denver.</p><p>I‚Äôve had an idea for a new project, similar to Denver Devs but matching up more to the spaces and people I feel more naturally drawn to, and one that encourages a different tone and types of interactions. More on a small scale, more about making friends and finding third spaces than chatting about the latest framework. I may or may not strike the project up ‚Äî it‚Äôs been in my head for a while now, but I‚Äôve had a sense of guilt whenever I think about it - like I‚Äôd be abandoning Denver Devs and instead focusing on something new. Putting it out here like this pushes it one step closer to not being just a dream - but maybe it just stays that way.</p><p>A lot is going on in my head related to this potential new endeavor, and if it sounds exciting and you‚Äôd like to chat more about it, feel free to DM me or email me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a tiny update but I decided to move my blog from markdown to a CMS and ultimately landed on Ghost. I tried a few others, but Ghost felt the most straightforward and simple for my needs: just writing blogs. The interface is clean, and works well enough on my phone (so I can quickly capture blog ideas on mobile if I need to and stash them as drafts). <br><br>Using markdown was fun, in theory, but started to quickly show its limitations when I wanted to add images or other content. I know you can do that just fine with markdown - but the process of uploading and managing media via version control was just zero fun to me. <br><br>Oh, I also moved from Netlify to Vercel, not for any big reason - I was just curious how Vercel would work for me after being on Netlify for years. So far I'm happy with it. <br><br>Up next is getting Vercels OG image to work with my site. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in January 2022, I've been on a path of reckoning and recalibration. I dove headfirst into therapy, which went well while also focusing on improving my overall health (since much of my anxiety stems from health / physical feelings). Over time I've learned what my body &amp; mind need and that if I neglect any of these areas, anxiety can start to rumble back up. I'm sure we've all heard the analogy of a body being like a car; you need regular checkups and maintenance to keep that car healthy.</p><h3 id="heres-my-maintenance-schedule-for-anxiety">Here's my maintenance schedule for anxiety:</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>I have to limit my daily caffeine intake. I used to slurp down both cold brew and diet soda on the same day, pushing my caffeine intake beyond 400mg. Now, I keep it to a single cup of coffee a day or two shots of espresso. That's about 64mg to 91mg of caffeine. Any more than that, and my monkey mind starts to chatter.- I have to take medicine daily at the same time. This one is relatively low effort, but it took me a bit to find a system that worked because I can tend to be forgetful about taking my medicine. I now have a small case with my anxiety + allergy meds in it (each in split compartments), and on Sunday, I fill each pod up with seven pills. I also use Apple Health to track my medication since that's a feature in iOS 16.</li>
<li>I have to limit my alcohol intake to one or three drinks a week, but usually much less. A beer, on occasion, used to be something I enjoyed but have to shy away from now. If I drink too much the following day isn't met with your typical hangover; it's met with a substantial uptick in anxiety levels, which can kick off a loop.</li>
<li>I have to move. Maybe not every day, and perhaps not a strenuous activity, but if I begin to neglect movement - even just a couple of weeks - anxiety can come on strong and be harder to control. A daily walk, plus something to get the heart pumping three times a week or so, has been beneficial.</li>
<li>I have to accept fleeting aches and pains. This mantra has been the biggest one for me. Any sharp discomfort or pain can immediately throw me into an anxiety spiral. I have to remind myself some aches and pains can be expected, or a product of prior anxiety, and to let them pass through me. It's much easier said than done, but I'm getting there.</li>
<li>I have to watch and correct my posture constantly. I tend to slump forward and compress my shoulders together, squeezing my chest, which can cause sharp pains to emanate from my chest. It's a freaky reminder to sit straight, pull your shoulders down, relax, and breathe.</li>
<li>I have to plan for when anxiety hits, depending on what I'm doing. Out for a drive? At the mall? Out with friends? Thankfully, most of these activities distract me and keep anxiety (and the accompanying aches and pains) away. But there's always the &quot;just in case,&quot; and thankfully, my SO, which is usually with me, totally understands if I need to step away for a bit.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What I'm saying here may not seem surprising if you've had anxiety or know anyone who has. This maintenance is all run-of-the-mill stuff; hell, I likely have it easier than quite a few people out there. My point isn't to draw attention to myself but to break into that strange stigma around <em>_talking_</em> about anxiety and mental health and what you can do about it. So here it is. None of this should be taken as advice or mirrored without consulting a doctor first.</p><p>But nonetheless: remember to take care of yourselves, folks.<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much like the shoemakers' children, my website has received very little of the same attention and care that I give to my professional work. Typically I've booted up a page in a single day, reaching for whatever framework or styles look the easiest and calling it at that. This year I wanted to return to my design roots and take a crack at making something for myself that I'd be proud of.</p><p>Before we dive in much further, I won't be writing about how I made my website. It's Next.js, Tailwind, and AirTable. A tale we've heard countless times and not something I need to add to the internet.</p><p>I started the design process by consulting with Jana, my significant other and incredibly talented art director. I haven't focused on just design in so long that I felt out of touch. Where do I start? A simple mood board was her suggestion.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-5.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/moodboard-2-1.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1156"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-3.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/post-cover_o-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675"></figure><p>I gathered examples from artists, packaging I like, and, surprisingly, trains. Now, I don't have some fascination with trains; I'm not a train guy (no harm in being one) - but I've always really felt <em>_something_</em> about the typography on trains. The simple, practical nature, typically pure white to contrast whatever industrial metal backdrop it sits on, hits right.</p><p>Despite the magnetic pull from the train typography, I decided to explore more, following the threads I had created from the other examples‚Äîfuturism, with its beautiful intricate lines, model packaging with its bold typography, and almost militant execution. It all kept circling back to keeping it simple and clean. Jana said at one point, "Your style is like future industrial. You could see it on the side of a giant spaceship somewhere" - and, you know, I like that.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-1.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/example-1_o.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="1117"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-1.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/example-2_o.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="1117"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-3.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/example-3.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="2976"></figure><p>So I dug in further, simplifying the palette and typography - letting the type come to the forefront and pushing back some extraneous elements. The color palette of my "dark mode", with its deep warm grays and blacks contrasted by that marigold, was <em>_very_</em> much a call to modern Tank cars‚Äîthose big black tubes with white text and that familiar marigold and it started to really feel right to me. I pulled some ideas together, ultimately simplifying and putting my touch on them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-3.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/example-6.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1728" height="2976"></figure><p>I splashed some transparent overlays in here and there, something of a nod to Apple's design style, which I'm a big fan of, and working with concepts of "materials." For example, I love frosted glass or acrylic, the harshness and softness it creates work nicely with the overall almost brutalist design. You can see this bit of material in the header, and down in the "Read" &amp; "Play" sections of the homepage if you scroll or swipe sideways.</p><p>For now, I'm content - but as most designers know, it's hard to rest on one's laurels. So I'll likely come back and tweak and adjust things in the future - or find ways to extend what exists with themes. You'd be surprised how much changing the typeface and a few colors can alter the vibe of a design - and I'm excited to play in this space more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[After spending most of 2022 dealing with generalized anxiety disorder, caused by many reasons: always being online, health, and well... *gestures broadly*; I decided to take a break from my community ( Denver Devs ) and Discord. That snowballed into disconnecting from a lot more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>2022 was a rough start for me. Six days into the new year, I wound up at the ER due to chest pain, heart palpitations, and racing thoughts that I couldn't calm down. I knew I was likely okay, but chest pain isn't something I've experienced before, so I thought it best to head into the ER. After multiple EKGs and a blood test, the doctor concluded it was probably just stress and maybe too much caffeine. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician the next day and went in for another checkup. After another series of tests, he concluded that I had a generalized anxiety disorder. We built up a care plan, and I hopped into therapy. My intake test said I was experiencing severe anxiety, stress, and depression levels.</p><p>What source of stress and anxiety was putting me in this spot? After months of therapy, we concluded that I might be spending too much time working. I didn't think I was. My work-life balance with Cisco has been fantastic, but that's when my therapist clarified: Denver Devs, the community I run, is <em>_work_</em>. And it would take up most of my hours outside of paid work. I'm a stubborn type, so I kept pushing through and working on myself - exercising, meditating, doing breathing exercises, and eating better. However, I was still plugged into Denver Devs, and my admin team felt the brunt. I'd wade into our private channels and spew line after line of what ultimately amounted to me just showing how damn burnt out I was.</p><p>July rolls around, and after some more pitfalls around health and life, I decided it's time to check out for a bit, so I let the community know I'm taking August off. The support I received in that move was touching, and immediately I felt stress melt away. So on August 1st, I deleted Discord from my phone and computers. At this time, I also decided to take a break from Twitter, which I'd spend most of my day scrolling through mindlessly as code was built or I was stuck on a problem. So the next day I woke up giddy and took the time to sit outside in the morning and, for once, not check Discord or Twitter immediately.</p><p>But I still felt the nagging in my head to check something... news, feed readers, mail, and so on. So I'd pop open my phone and take in the home page filled with apps, muscle memory would take over, and I'd get to tapping. It wasn't long into the technology sabbatical that I realized: I wasn't really enjoying my time on the internet. So I took it a step further and began the great cleanup of my digital life.</p><p>I got to work by taking cues from the countless books and articles that push this kind of technological disconnect. I unsubscribed from useless email lists and newsletters. Relentlessly purged my RSS feeds. Deleted my news &amp; Reddit apps. Set up screen time limits on my various devices and cleaned up my phone home screen to be something I enjoyed looking at.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://res-1.cloudinary.com/dznptdira/image/upload/q_auto/v1/blog-images/digital-disconnect-homescreen.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675"></figure><p>A month in, and how am I doing? Well, I learned I like to play Solitare a lot - and had to put an hour daily cap on that. Outside of that, as you might expect, my mind feels quieter. I spend most mornings, sometimes as early as 6:40am to around 8:40am, sitting outside, sipping coffee, and not looking at my phone. I've become such a regular at it that in passing, a neighbor said, "I've seen you on your patio in the mornings. That looks relaxing."</p><p>My work days are happier for it, too. I don't spend time flicking back and forth between distractions. RescueTime reports that I have fewer than 4 context switches in a given hour, which is much better than the 80 plus I had before. I also reduced the physical aspect of my workspace significantly, but I'll save that for another blog.</p><p>Outside work, with friends, or with my significant other, I'm not compelled to check everything. One unexpected side-effect, too, is that I don't feel like spending much time in video games, which is a regular pastime of mine. I'm still figuring out the why on that one. Maybe my mind doesn't need the escapism they provided me.<br>Much of what I'm saying shouldn't come as a surprise. There are books and articles aplenty out there about the benefits of disconnecting. I'm happy I finally took the time and discipline to do it.</p><p>I'm writing this article a few days before my break ends, and I'd be lying if the anxiety wasn't bubbling back up a little. So what's it going to be like when I get back? Do I hop on to all the apps I got rid of and ride that dopamine wave of notifications and new content? I'd rather not, so I've got a plan.</p><p>I'll set office hours for Denver Devs, checking in on the Discord no more than an hour a day spread throughout the day. Of course, if I'm working on something code related to Denver Devs, I'll timebox that a bit too, but honestly, that work is something I enjoy, so I don't see the harm. Outside of Discord, I'm going to set up limits on Twitter. My RSS feed is now just a handful of sources, and I'll keep it that way. I don't think I'll go back to my News apps or Reddit - those places I don't miss checking.</p><p>I'm excited and anxious to see how long I can keep my willpower up and where it takes me. I have missed feeling connected to others. Discord chats and tweets were my main lifeline to other people outside of work and the occasional text message. Still, I need to remember that my goal is to foster positive connections - not constant ones.</p><p>I don't have as much chest pain anymore, and I'd like to keep it that way.<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>
